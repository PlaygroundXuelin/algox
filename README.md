# notes
## microservie
  misconceptions: 
    use any languages (supporting a new language is expensive)
    code generation is evil (just a tool)

  invest in tools / automations. Maintaining a service is cheap. 
  API linter. api consistency.
  code generation. generate router, clients, generate mock client. generate everything from spec.
    generate table creation sql.
      hash code to minimize write.
    generate tests.
  database: owned by a service and not accessible by other services.
    uniform CLI interface.
  continuous delivery: essential, prerequisite
    deploy triggered by git tag
    git tag created by PR merge in git
    dashboard


  keep infrastructure spec simple
  standardize health check (internal api)

  visibility of errors (details enought to reproduce)  is important
